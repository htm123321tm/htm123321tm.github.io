    <p>Every single player has to beat this stage in order to advance in the mid game. Bullet train cat, the reward for
    beating this stage, is a really useful rusher with the second highest speed in the whole game. At level 50, it can deal
    up to 48500 damage; combined with its instant attack animation, he is almost guaranteed to pack a powerful punch on the enemies.</p>
    <p>Personally, I feel that this stage is not very hard but it is the first stage that introduces most players bahamut timing techniques on R.ost.
    This is really important as it requires actual effort to have bahamut land a hit on R.ost, making it the a good timing practice for new players</p>
    <p> Some people say that the explosion talent for bahamut cat has destroyed the stage, but I don't think so. The probability of you getting bahamut
    talent before attempting the stage is just a little bit higher than that of Mbappe winning the Champion League.</p>
