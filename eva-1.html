    <p>Despite PONOS adding a new uber and even a new legend to this banner, Asukasli still remains unrivaled. Her destructive surge attacks and good range can
    crush any enemies approching the army. This is reasonable, as Asukasli's design is obviously derived from Dasli, the top 1 uber in the game for a long period of time.</p>
    <p>As much as I extol Asukasli, I can't say that all the remaining units are bad. For instance, we have Rei the Oracle which is a copy of Mitama the Oracle. Kaoru is
    also a great unit with insane damage to traitless enemy; although he can't compete with the OG anti traitless units like DGao, he is still a great choice against his target.</p>
