    <p>We'll meet again (Merciless) is the final stage in Unit 13 strikes!, featuring Awakened Unit 13 as the main boss. Beside from his unholy 4,000,000 HP, he 
    also wields high destructive power, dealing 100,000 damage every 5 seconds. Moreover, at 3-crown magnification, instead of the usual 130% buff, he gains an 
    enormous 300% buff, becoming extremely bulky at 12,000,000 HP and has an attack that can oneshot almost every unit in the game.</p>
    <p>The key to beating this stage is using spammable units to chip down his HP if you exclude the use of Eva-killer effect. Just a friendly reminder, DON'T BRING
    MEATSHIELDS. They will just make Unit 13's attacks land easier and make you lose.</p>
